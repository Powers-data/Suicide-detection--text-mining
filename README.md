# Suicide detection: text-mining
The data that I used in this project was scraped from Reddit; a collection of posts from "SuicideWatch" subreddits. And conducted several text-mining methods to detect suicidal posts. 

##	Project Description
Through studying Text Mining, data mining techniques were introduced to analyze text and develop insights from unstructured data. In this project, suicide detection was performed through text features processing and machine learning-based methods to the text data scraped from the online community platform Reddit. In this exercise, Python is used for data collection, preprocessing, and performing five prediction models; Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes model, SVM model, Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree model, and Random Forest model.
